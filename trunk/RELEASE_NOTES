r175
working prototype (for me anyway)
dts-portal has been provided
dts-ws throws proper exceptions
dts-wsclient can catch and map those exceptions
xmlbean is used as the OXM
uses myproxy authentication to access grid file systems
uses plain username password authentication for others
uses jaas
spring validator is used on the dts-ws


r133
working version of the dts that needs a few more features
implemented before it can be called a prototype. this version
still uses jaxb
