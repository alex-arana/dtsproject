A comparison between DMI and JSDL and some related issues.

At present, we have resorted to a composite schema that combines both JSDL^1^ and DMI^2^ elements with our own proprietary extensions. Ideally, we would like to produce a standards compliant message format and Web Service implementation (rather than resorting to our proprietary format). This wiki identifies some key issues/extensions.

===Non-WSRF DMI rendering (Doc-literal/RESTfull)===
DMI is currently very WSRF centric. We require a document-literal/RESTfull approach as defined in the rendering at the links below. 
The key difference between this document-centric rendering and the DMI WSRF-centric approach is that we pass JobIDs back to the client rather than WS-Addressing Endpoint References (the endpoint reference points to a DMI service Instance that was previously created from a factory).

===Multiple transfers in DMI=== 
The DMI functional spec can be used to define a single data transfer between a single source and sink. To accommodate multiple transfers, the client interacts with DMI to create multiple service instances, each responsible for a separate transfer. This requires many communications between the client and service (e.g. in the case of 1000 separate files).  
We need to be able to define multiple data transfers within the same request message. To do this, we have devised the following 'dmi-wrapped' rendering that effectively wraps a source and sink DEPR within a single parent element which can be defined/repeated  multiple times within a single request.

===Extensions===
Add something like the jsdl:CreationOption (overwrite, dontOverwrite, append) to the dmi:
