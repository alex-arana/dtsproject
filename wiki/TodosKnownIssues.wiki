Todos and Known Issues 
This project is currently in Development - sorry no releases yet. 

= Remaining Developer Todos =

  * Change the format of the job request from the current xsd:red'd JSDL to the new DataCopy document (bulk data copy doc inspired by DMI). 
  * Fix the known commons-vfs-grid api bug associated with copying very large files with gridftp (this is not a bug with VFS or gridftp, rather its a bug with the commons-vfs-grid VFSUtil stuff - Dave knows about this). 
  * Complete the message exchange between a worker node client and the worker node. No probs/issues to fix here, rather there are just remaining todos to complete the message flow. 
  * Update: jobQueueSender, controlQueueSender in order to pass down custom headers, including the message id. 
  * Add an eventQueueListener (to the common module?) for worker node clients. 
  * We *really* need a workernode client (such as the WebService) that can submit jobs to the broker, and filter for events/status. Currently lacking developer effort to do this ! 
  * Configure the batch job to support chosen protocols.
