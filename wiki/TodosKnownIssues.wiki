Todos and Known Issues 
This project is currently in Development - sorry no releases yet. 

= Remaining Developer Todos =

== Broker/message flow/worker node==

  * Change the format of the job request from the current xsd redef'd JSDL to the new DataCopy document (bulk data copy doc inspired by DMI). This will effect *all* the modules. 

  * Complete the message exchange between a worker node client and the worker node. No probs/issues to fix here, rather there are just remaining todos to complete the message flow. 

  * Update: jobQueueSender, controlQueueSender in order to pass down custom headers, including the message id. 

  * Add an eventQueueListener (to the common module?) for worker node clients. 

  * We *really* need a workernode client (such as the WebService) that can submit jobs to the broker, and filter for events/status updates. Currently lacking developer effort to do this ! 

== Batch Job ==

  * Fix the known commons-vfs-grid api bug associated with copying very large files with gridftp (this is not a bug with VFS or gridftp, rather its a bug with the commons-vfs-grid VFSUtil stuff - Dave knows about this). 

  * Update the batch job to support chosen protocols. 

  * Update the batch job to support gridftp put/get rather than streaming (which is default). 

  * Configure the batch job to persist credentials in the credentialStore (false by default). This is required in order to re-start jobs after hardware failure.
